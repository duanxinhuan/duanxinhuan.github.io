# Australia: Learning from Europe to Prevent Extremism

As we witness the challenges facing Europe, including declining social mobility, rising inequality, and increasing political fragmentation, it’s essential for Australia to take heed. The specter of extremist ideologies re-emerging, reminiscent of figures like Hitler, highlights the dangers of a society where power is concentrated and citizens feel powerless. To avoid similar pitfalls, Australia can implement strategies that foster a flat competition structure, ensuring that discontent does not spiral into radicalism.

## Social Mobility: A Catalyst for Extremism

In early 20th-century Germany, Adolf Hitler’s rise was not merely due to his personal ambition but also the socio-political environment of the time. Germany was in chaos: economic devastation, national humiliation from the Treaty of Versailles, and class immobility created fertile ground for extremism. When people feel trapped in their social standing, with no avenues for upward mobility, they are more likely to be attracted to radical ideas that promise upheaval.

Hitler's ascendance was rooted in his ability to exploit mass frustration. The lack of social mobility forced many to seek salvation in extreme solutions. This remains relevant today; the social and economic pressures that contributed to Hitler's rise have not disappeared. Economic inequality continues to grow, and many people feel locked in their socio-economic positions, unable to improve their lives despite hard work.

## Is Today’s Society Any Different?

Today, social mobility remains a critical issue:

- **Economic Inequality**: Although there have been improvements in the social safety net across Europe, many still face stagnation. The gap between the wealthy and the poor continues to widen, especially in countries hit hard by the 2008 financial crisis. The modern European Union (EU) reflects a scenario where "old money" benefits disproportionately from the current economic system, often reaping the rewards of policies that favor established interests while leaving behind the working class.

- **Disenfranchisement and Alienation**: Large segments of society, particularly in rural or economically depressed regions, feel ignored by traditional political structures. As they see elites prospering from globalization, they begin to feel that the system is rigged against them.

- **Political Extremism**: In response, people gravitate toward leaders who promise to tear down existing systems. Just as Hitler channeled resentment into nationalism and xenophobia, modern-day populists tap into dissatisfaction with the status quo.

## The Role of Old Money in Modern Europe

In contemporary Europe, the persistence of "old money" influences economic inequality significantly. Wealth and power remain concentrated among established elites, often perpetuating a system that favors their interests. As a result, many individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds see little hope for upward mobility, breeding frustration and disillusionment.

This concentration of wealth can create a feedback loop where the privileged class maintains control over political systems, further entrenching their status. The impact of old money is evident in various policies that prioritize capital over labor, exacerbating the divide and leading many to seek radical alternatives.

## Extremism in Different Forms

While we may not see a fascist leader like Hitler in the future, the underlying social conditions of inequality and stagnation could still produce a figure of similar extremism from a different ideological spectrum. The lack of social mobility creates an environment where individuals feel their circumstances are unchangeable, fostering resentment and hopelessness. This can lead to the emergence of radical leaders, whether from the far-left, radical environmentalists, or techno-authoritarian movements.

Various movements are already capitalizing on economic elites' resentment and the political system, much like Hitler did in the 1920s and 30s:

- Right-wing populists like Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orbán in Hungary are building movements based on nationalism and anti-immigration sentiments.
- Left-wing populists in parts of Southern Europe or Latin America promise socialist redistribution of wealth, nationalization of resources, and an attack on capitalism.
- Environmental radicals may rise with authoritarian tendencies in response to climate change, proposing draconian restrictions on personal freedoms or economic activities.

Each of these movements resonates with the frustrations of those who feel trapped, echoing the conditions that facilitated Hitler's rise to power.

## No Social Mobility, No Stability

The root cause, both in Hitler's rise and in the potential for future radical leaders, is the lack of social mobility. When individuals believe they have no chance of improving their lives, they become more willing to embrace extremism, even at the expense of democratic principles or the welfare of others. Without avenues for upward mobility—through education, jobs, housing, and wealth creation—people will continue to look for leaders who promise to overthrow the current system, regardless of whether those leaders promote authoritarianism or chaos.

## Conclusion: The Risk of Extremism Persists

While history does not repeat itself exactly, the structural conditions of stagnation and inequality could lead to a new figure of extremism. This figure may not be a right-wing dictator like Hitler but could represent another political extreme, from radical leftism to authoritarian environmentalism.

To prevent the rise of another "Hitler"—or a "Hitler" from another ideological spectrum—governments and societies must prioritize social mobility, address economic inequality, and create opportunities for all. By dismantling the entrenched power of old money and empowering the disenfranchised, Australia and other nations can create a more equitable society. Otherwise, the vacuum created by stagnation and frustration will continue to fuel extremist ideologies and leaders, whatever their political hue may be.
