## Tyranny Around Us - Why we Cant afford anything any more?

It's hard for me to start anything especially when its not about my career, but the feeling of saddness and compassionate to Aussie people eventually drives me to start writing a series of blogs eventually. When I first come to Australia at 2018, it was an vabriant and flourish country with beautiful weather and lovely people, things were a bit expensive but still affordable. Schools are nice, people are smilling, I hate to admit but it's much better than where I came from. However, if we look at today, the situation is not as nice: getting a decend place is almost impossible, gasoline and car insurance are sky rocketing...

So, what has happened? It's hard to answer this question in a single sentence or even an article but if we really needs to give a short anwser I would just say, it's tyranny or more specific tyranny from legibility. I would like to give further explanation on the following sections and give a brief idea on what I would like to talk about:

**The myth of city planning and zone regulation** - In this blog I would give you a very in detial explanation on why city planning and zone regulation actually cause the shortage of accomodation and they exsits only for collecting more money from people.

**Legacy local protection is not protecting anybody** - Local protection is a good way to help local bussiness to grow. However, there are a few local protections that makes sense in the past but now only serves for geting cost-of-living-crisis worse.

**The imbalance distribution of money from immigration** - There is no doubt that immigrants spends a lot of money, working hard and bring a lot of fancy stuffs to Australia. But it's also very true that it's not benifiting everybody, and the huge immbalance is the reason why a group of people are anti-immigrarion despite in general immigrants benefit the country.

**The regulator exists doesn't mean it's working** - We are not safe from regulation, we are safe from a working regulation. Regulation and enforcement of rules are expensive, we can't afford all of them especially the broken ones.

**Net zero is not zero** - Achieving the 'Net Zero' goal is indeed a good approach to reduce carbon emmison if it is caculated properly or correctly.

I wish I could finish all of them, and eventually get things published. But inshort, Tyranny creates unaffordability. If we don't stand up againt it we will all be suffering from it.
