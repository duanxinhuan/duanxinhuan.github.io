# Why AI Will Not Benefit Humanity: Medicare and Law Prove It

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been marketed as the key to unlocking a better future, promising to solve our biggest societal challenges. Yet, two of the most critical areas—Medicare and law—remain as convoluted and inaccessible as ever. If AI could truly revolutionize these sectors, we should have already seen significant improvements. But instead, they remain tangled in bureaucracy and inefficiency, proving that AI isn’t delivering the benefits humanity desperately needs.

## Medicare: An Overdue Revolution That Never Happened

Healthcare, specifically Medicare, was one of the areas where AI was supposed to shine. AI proponents promised faster diagnosis, personalized treatments, and streamlined patient care. However, in practice, the system remains a nightmare for millions of people. Navigating Medicare is still a bureaucratic maze, riddled with confusing paperwork, delays in services, and opaque pricing structures. AI’s involvement—whether in automating administrative tasks or assisting in diagnostics—hasn’t simplified the system or made healthcare more accessible.

If AI could truly benefit humanity, Medicare would be the ultimate success story. Automated systems should have already eliminated the paperwork backlog, optimized patient care, and made health services universally accessible and affordable. Instead, we still have patients struggling to understand their coverage, dealing with denied claims, and facing skyrocketing healthcare costs. AI hasn't fixed the fundamental issues in the system because it’s being applied piecemeal, with no real focus on improving the patient experience or addressing the inefficiencies that plague the industry.

## The Legal System: Still a Nightmare, Despite AI's Potential

The legal system is another area where AI was supposed to bring clarity and efficiency. Legal processes are notoriously slow, expensive, and often unfairly skewed toward those with the most resources. AI was supposed to streamline case management, speed up legal proceedings, and make legal services more accessible to everyday people. Yet, the system remains as opaque and difficult to navigate as ever.

AI has been used in legal technology, sure—predictive analytics to assist in case outcomes, or document review for legal research—but these tools have largely served to benefit law firms and corporations, not ordinary citizens. If AI could truly disrupt the legal system for the better, access to justice should be easier, faster, and more affordable by now. Instead, we have an even more complicated system where AI tools are wielded by those with money and power, further widening the gap between those who can afford quality legal representation and those who can't.

## AI Benefits Those in Power, Not the People

The failure of AI to improve Medicare and law highlights a larger truth: AI serves the interests of those who control it. In both sectors, the technology is used to make systems more efficient for businesses, corporations, and institutions, not for the people who depend on these services. If AI was genuinely going to help humanity, it should have already broken through these pain points, making Medicare and legal processes more transparent, affordable, and accessible.

But instead of addressing these complex, deeply human challenges, AI is used for optimizing profits, automating routine tasks, or predicting consumer behavior. The promise that AI will eventually improve our lives in these sectors is becoming more and more of a pipe dream. If it could have done so, we would already be living in that reality.

## Conclusion

Medicare and law remain two of the most frustrating and inefficient systems in society. Despite AI’s potential to simplify and improve these areas, it has done little to alleviate the burdens people face. The reality is clear: AI is not the revolutionary force for good it was promised to be. If it truly had the capacity to benefit humanity, we would have seen meaningful change by now. Instead, it serves the interests of those who are already in power, leaving the rest of us to navigate the same old bureaucratic mess.
