# A positive story is a story written by the winners

LinkedIn is a great reflection on the mordern society. Working a job is never easy or even painful but the things people tell the most on LinkIn are positive stuffs, the ironic behind it is significant. When I browse LinkedIn the thought that comes to my mind is what's people's true feeling under those 'positve stories' or even darker - are they real? Regardless it's real or not, I have to seriously pick up a pain that has been there for thoughsands of years - stories that are written by the winners. It's indeed not a good thing because it's reflecting the wrong perspective and it can be misleading to the next generations. Believe or not, despite we are having cameras, social medias and tiktoks, we are still having this problem. What's even worse, the multi-media might make the winner looks even better.

## So how comes a positive story is a story written by the winners?

A very interesting fact that I learned from almost all human societies I have lived in (Australian and Chinese). People are more likely to perceive history as narritives rather than a chronicle of human civilizations. Those who are actually brutal or autocratic are percieved as heroes because they write the history and they can get those story tellers to put all the positive words on them. So brutal becomes brave, autocratic becomes firm and intolerant becomes divine.

## So how positive story today creates 'winner' by winner and mislead you 

Before even starting this section, I would like to clarify who are the 'winner's and who are the real winners:

- 'Winner's: The good looking people on the television that positive impression and words are attached to.
- Real winner: Those who are rich

As I metioned in the last section people are grown up reading hero stories, so the best way to sell stuff to people are by creating histories with halo on top of their head. People will use what they use and follow what they do because people love hero stories and appreciate hero. However very unfortunately those artifical heroes are not real, they are just dellusions.

We have seen stories of 'heathy model' died because of malnutrition in their apartment, idols are convicted as rapists. They are never who they are, they try their best to play the 'hero' for making a living. They serve the 'real' winners for more profit.

In a nutshall, focus on yourself.
